# Valentine's Day Card Ideas

Creative ways to make a webpage where clicking "No" is nearly impossible.

## Movement & Evasion

1. **The Dodger** - "No" button moves away from cursor on hover, getting faster each time they try
2. **Teleporter** - "No" button randomly teleports to different screen positions when approached
3. **Runaway Button** - "No" button literally runs away using smooth animations, leaving a trail
4. **Edge Scroller** - "No" button moves to screen edges, and when cornered, scrolls the page to escape

## Size Manipulation

5. **The Shrinker** - "No" button gets smaller with each hover attempt until it's 1px
6. **The Grower** - "Yes" button grows larger each time they hover "No", eventually covering the whole screen
7. **Perspective Trick** - "No" button appears to recede into the distance using CSS 3D transforms

## Deception & Trickery

8. **The Switcharoo** - Buttons swap positions when they move cursor toward "No"
9. **Fake Buttons** - Multiple "No" buttons appear, but they're all fake and clicking leads to "Yes"
10. **Invisible Wall** - "No" button has invisible padding that makes "Yes" get clicked instead
11. **Auto-Correct** - "No" button changes to "Yes" right before click registers

## Guilt & Persuasion

12. **Sad Puppy Mode** - Each hover over "No" shows progressively sadder images/messages
13. **Consequence Counter** - Shows dramatic "consequences" like "World sadness: +10%" when hovering "No"
14. **Reverse Psychology** - "No" button text changes: "Sure?" → "Really?" → "Please?" → "You mean Yes?"

## Gamification

15. **Captcha Challenge** - "No" requires solving impossible math problems or identifying all traffic lights in 100 images
16. **Boss Battle** - Must defeat a mini-game boss to unlock the "No" button
17. **Timer Challenge** - "No" button only appears for 0.01 seconds before disappearing

## Technical Tricks

18. **Z-Index Trap** - "Yes" button has higher z-index and slightly overlaps "No"
19. **Cursor Hijack** - Cursor gets "magnetically" pulled toward "Yes" button
20. **Disabled State** - "No" button appears clickable but is actually disabled with cursor:not-allowed

## Nuclear Options

21. **Browser Closer** - Hovering "No" triggers window.close() attempt or "battery low" warning
22. **The Multiplier** - Each "No" hover spawns 2 more "Yes" buttons until screen is covered
23. **404 Error** - Clicking "No" shows fake "404: Love Not Found" then redirects to "Yes"

## Top Recommendations

- **The Dodger** - Classic and effective
- **The Grower** - Visually funny
- **The Switcharoo** - Sneaky and surprising
